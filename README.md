## Lessons Learned
this project was very similar to the module content with a few differences. I had a difficult time debugging the user virtuals at first because it was throwing a reading undefined length. However I enjoyed working with MongoDb more than MySql so far because of how it can adjust to our needs without the fuss of dropping databases when adjustments were needed. Mongo is far less strict than traditional Sql. However I could see how this could be an issue with mongo especially when strict order would be needed like ex. medical database.
